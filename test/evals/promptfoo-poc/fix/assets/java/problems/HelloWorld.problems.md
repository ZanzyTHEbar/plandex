The updated file incorrectly includes placer comments like '// existing init code...' and '// rest of your class...' These comments are placeholders not replaced by actual code from the original file. Such comments could mislead developers into thinking there's additional initial setup code or more content within the class that's not present. These comments should be replaced with the exact code they're referring to if any, or removed if unnecessary.
