1. The error handling logic for 'birthYear' being in the future has been added, but it does not prevent the rest of the function from executing.
2. The console.log statement to print the age is always executed, even when the birthYear is in the future.
3. The original function's return statement was replaced with a console.log, but the final console.log outside the function incorrectly remains, intending to demonstrate the function's usage.
